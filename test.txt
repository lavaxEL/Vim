The Domain Name System (DNS) is a hierarchical and decentralized naming system for computers, services, 
or other resources connected to the Internet or a private network. It as
sociates various information with domain names assigned to each of the participating entities. Most pro
minently, it translates more readily memorized domain names to the numerical IP addresses needed for locating and identifying computer services and devices with the unde
rlying network protocols. By providing a worldwide, distributed directory se
rvice, the Domain Name System has been an essential component of the functionality of the Internetfdfsdfsdf
 since 1985.
The Domain Name System delegates the responsibility of assigning domain names
 and mapping those names to Internet resources by designating authoritative name serv
ers for each domain. Network administrators may delegate authority over sub-domains of their allocated name space to other name servers. This mechanism provides distributed 
and fault-tolerant service and was designed to avoid a single large central database.
The Domain Name System also specifies the technical functionality of the databa
se service that is at its core. It defines 
the DNS protocol, a detailed specification of the data structures and data communication exchanges used in the DNS, as part of the Internet Protocol Suite.
The Internet maintains two principal namespaces, the domain name hierarchy[1] and the Internet Protocol (IP) address spaces.[2] The D
omain Name System maintains the domain name hierarchy and provides translation services between it and the address spaces. Internet name servers and a
 communication protocol implement the Domain Name System.[3] A DNS name server is a server that stores the DNS records for a domain; a DNS name server
 responds with answers to queries against its database.
The most common types of records stored in the DNS database are for Start of Authority (SOA), IP addresses (A and AAAA), SMTP mail exchan
gers (MX), name servers (NS), pointers for reverse DNS lookups (PTR), and domain name aliases (CNAME). Although not intended to be a gener
al purpose database, DNS has been expanded over time to store records for other types of data for either automatic lookups, such as DNSSEC rec
ords, or for human queries such as responsible person (RP) records. As a general purpose database, the DNS has also been used in combating unsol
icited email (spam) by storing a real-time blackhole list (RBL). The DNS database is traditionally stored in a structured text file, the zone file, but ot
her database systems are common.ÿ
